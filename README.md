I would highly recommend using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for this project. It will make accessing the terminal window for each container much easier.

Clone the repo, then run this command in the parent direcvtory: `docker-compose up --build -d`

The first thing you should do is register for an account. After you do that, you'll need to select the "Create A New Campaign" option from the Account Profile page. Once those two steps are complete, you can begin to explore the various capabilities of web app. A good first step would be to click the "Add Items" button on the Inventory page and upload the included CSV called "Items" which will provide a variety of starter items to work with. You'll need to have other users registered to join your campaign in order to issue items to them.
