I would highly recommend using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for this project. It will make accessing the terminal window for each container much easier.

Clone the repo, then run this command in the parent direcvtory: `docker-compose up --build -d`. It will take awhile the first time because Docker will have to download several images and then build the web app. Once the build is successful and all the containers are running, you'll be able to access the web app at `localhost` in your web browser.

The first thing you should do is register for an account. After you do that, you'll need to select the "Create A New Campaign" option from the Account Profile page. Once those two steps are complete, you can begin to explore the various capabilities of web app. A good first step would be to click the "Add Items" button on the Inventory page and upload the included CSV called "Items" which will provide a variety of starter items to work with. You'll need to have other users registered to join your campaign in order to issue items to them. If you need to have separate tabs open for the DM and the Player users, use a priavte session or Incognito Mode so the tokens don't clash.
